## Linked lists:

**linked list** refers to one type of data structure where data is stored into nodes and those nodes are then stored into a list. 
Each **node** saves at least a pointer to next node, creating a link betwen then, thus creating a linked list. <br>
In most types of linked lists the last node points to null as there is no next node to point at.

A node stores all of the informations that the linked list contains, usually nodes are composed of another type of data structure as well like dynamic array's. <br>

There are many types of linked lists:
- Singly
- Doubly
- Circular
